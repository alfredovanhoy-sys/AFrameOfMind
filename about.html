                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>AFrameOfMind was born from a simple desire to create the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Nestled in the heart of pristine mountain wilderness, our cozy cabins offer a unique blend of rustic charm and modern comfort that allows guests to truly disconnect and recharge.</p>
                        
                        <p>Founded in 2018 by nature enthusiasts Sarah and Michael Thompson, AFrameOfMind began as a personal retreat that friends and family couldn't stop talking about. What started as a single A-frame cabin has grown into a collection of thoughtfully designed retreats, each offering its own unique character while maintaining the core values of tranquility, comfort, and connection with nature.</p>
